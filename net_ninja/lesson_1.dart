// About Dart.
/*
- Language used to make multi-platform applications.
- Dart code needs to be compiled to native machine code or JavaScript for web.
- Statically typed language (every variable has its own types)
- Lets say we have `var first_name = "mario"` the variable can only ever be a string and not another type.
- For arch linux `sudo pacman -S dart` or visit `dartpad.dev` online.
